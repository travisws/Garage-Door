# Garage-Door
Need to make it more clear and easy to understand README.md at some point.

You need java 8 or 9 on your Raspberry pi. Put the PiServerSide on to you pi and compile the folder(Will add a .jar to the repo.) to a .jar, then run.
Your Android phone need to have kitkat or newer and to have android studio. Open the GarageDoorOpenerAndroidApp folder (Need to rename.) then bulid(I will add a APK... Some time.).
