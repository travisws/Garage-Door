# Garage-Door
Need to make it more clear and easy to understand README.md at some point.

You need java 8 or 9 on your Raspberry pi. Put the PiServerSide on to you pi and compile the folder to a .jar (Will add a .jar to the repo.), then run. Your Android phone will need to have kitkat or newer and to have install android studio to compile the code. Open the GarageDoorOpenerAndroidApp folder (Need to rename.) then bulid(I will add a APK... Some time.).
